CTC-Connectionist Temporal Classification
=========================================

-CTC cost is implemented in pure [Theano](https://github.com/Theano/Theano).

-Supports mini-batch.

-Supports both normal- and log-scale.

-"apple" problem (two same consecutive labels) is solved.

-Test file is implemented using [Blocks](https://github.com/bartvm/blocks).
